# TCP-ChatRoom
Trying to create a working chatroom (Constantly improving)

Dont mind this project at all, just my OS Project :PPP 

v1.0 -> Implemented a basic chatroom with sockets and threads in python (almost very basic)

v2.0 -> Implemented Admin roles, kick and ban for the same role. But Admin role is quite unsafe......wondering what to do protecc admin :(.
